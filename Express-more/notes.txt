FOR AUTOMATIC SERVER RESTART
add 
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
},

in the package.json and type -> npm start (to directly open app.js)
-> so that server restarts on its own everytime we save any changes

or just add "nodemon"
and type npm start <filename>


app.use(express.static('public')); 
// middleware to load static files like css and js
// We're telling Express that for every incoming request, it should check if
// it's a request to a file that can be found here in this public folder.
// And if it is, then the file will be returned as a response.
// If it's not, the request will be forwarded to our other routes.
// And if there, we also have no route that handles the request, the request will fail.


const fs = require('fs'); // package for file system
const path = require('path'); // package to construct path

// to parse incoming request data
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false})); // middleware function to see if the req has any data and parse that

const fileData = fs.readFileSync(filePath); //this will be normal text not a JS obj or array
const existingUsers = JSON.parse(fileData); // parsing the normal text to JS object

fs.writeFileSync(filePath, JSON.stringify(existingUsers)); // cannot write existingUsers. Need to write normal text :: stringify
